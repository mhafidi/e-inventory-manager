# e-Inventory-manager

## Overview
e-Inventory-manager is an advanced backend system designed to dynamically manage inventory levels by utilizing real-time sales data and market trends. This system fetches data through HTTP requests from various merchant websites, including AliExpress, Shopify, Amazon, and more. By employing sophisticated machine learning algorithms, e-Inventory-manager forecasts stock requirements with high precision, effectively mitigating the risks of overstocking or stock shortages. The system also boasts seamless integration with supplier systems to automate the reordering process, ensuring inventory levels are optimally maintained according to both internal sales patterns and external market conditions.
