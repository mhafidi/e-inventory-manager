# Enhanced Inventory Management System

## Overview
The Enhanced Inventory Management System is a sophisticated backend solution designed to optimize inventory levels dynamically. By leveraging real-time sales data and market trends, the system employs machine learning algorithms to forecast stock requirements accurately, thus preventing overstocking and stockouts. It features seamless integration with supplier systems for automated reordering, ensuring that inventory levels are always aligned with sales patterns and market demands.

## Features
- **Dynamic Inventory Adjustment**: Automatically adjusts inventory based on real-time sales data and market trends.
- **Machine Learning Forecasting**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to predict stock needs accurately.
- **Automated Reordering**: Integrates with supplier systems to automate the reordering process, maintaining optimal stock levels.
- **Market Trend Analysis**: Analyzes market trends to adjust inventory preemptively.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure Java (version 8 or later) is installed on your system.
3. Navigate to the project directory and compile the source code using your preferred Java compiler or IDE.
4. Configure the `.env` file with necessary API keys and database credentials (if applicable).

## Usage
To run the system, execute the main class from the command line or your IDE. The system will begin monitoring sales data and market trends, adjusting inventory levels accordingly. Detailed logs and reports can be accessed within the system dashboard.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Primary programming language for backend development.
- **Spring Boot**: For creating the microservice architecture.
- **Apache Kafka**: For handling real-time data streams.
- **TensorFlow or PyTorch**: For implementing machine learning models (mock integration for POC).
- **RESTful APIs**: For communication with market and supplier systems.
